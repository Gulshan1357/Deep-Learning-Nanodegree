# Deep-Learning Nanodegree

This respository contains list of major projects in the form of Jupyter notebooks during Udacity's Nanodegree Program.



## Project 1: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns

Build and trained neural network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.



## Project 2: Dog-Breed Classifier

Designed and trained a convolutional neural network to analyze images of dogs and correctly identify their breeds. Used transfer learning and well-known architectures to improve this model.
